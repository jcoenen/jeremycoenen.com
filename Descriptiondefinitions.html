water capacity refers to the quantity of water that the soil is
capable of storing for use by plants. The capacity for water storage
is given in centimeters of water per centimeter of soil for each soil
layer. The capacity varies, depending on soil properties that affect
retention of water. The most important properties are the content of
organic matter, soil texture, bulk density, and soil structure, with
corrections for salinity and rock fragments. Available water capacity
is an important factor in the choice of plants or crops to be grown
and in the design and management of irrigation systems. It is not an
estimate of the quantity of water actually available to plants at any
given time.</FONT></P>

water supply (AWS) is computed as AWC times the thickness of the

water.</FONT></P>

each soil layer, AWC is recorded as three separate values in the

rating provides an indication of the proportion of the map unit that
meets the criteria for hydric soils. Map units that are dominantly
made up of hydric soils may have small areas, or inclusions, of
non-hydric soils in the higher positions on the landform, and map

hydric soils in the lower positions on the landform.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.04in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Hydric
soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric
Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation,
flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop
anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994).
Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or
inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth
and reproduction of hydrophylic vegetation.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.04in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are
associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific
soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific
information, such as information about the depth and duration of the
water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated
soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal
Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit
components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria
used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in
&quot;Soil Taxonomy&quot; (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and &quot;Keys to
Soil Taxonomy&quot; (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the &quot;Soil
Survey Manual&quot; (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993).</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.04in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">If
soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be
considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be
easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators
of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of
hydric soils are specified in &quot;Field Indicators of Hydric Soils
in the United States&quot; (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006).</FONT></P>
