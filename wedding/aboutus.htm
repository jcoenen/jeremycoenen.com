&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 17th, 2002, after 6 years of dating, Jeremy 
    finally proposed to me.&nbsp; He tried to make it romantic by shoving me in 
    one of the bedrooms at the cottage up north and telling me not to come out 
    until he said so.&nbsp; Here I waited over half an hour, only to see him 
    come in for two seconds to get something from his bag.&nbsp; He was all 
    dressed up so I thought, &quot;I can play this game too.&quot;&nbsp; I just happened 
    to have a dress with me that weekend, so I slipped it on.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeremy attempted to cook his 
    favorite (only) meal he can make, stir fry.&nbsp; A few things went awry 
    before actually sitting down to eat.&nbsp; Jeremy forgot to actually watch 
    the noodles and found them boiling all over the stove, cooked in the dark 
    because he didn't know he had a stove light to work with, and didn't have 
    any sauce.... but dry vegetables and noodles are ok!!&nbsp; I thank Jeremy's 
    dad, Roger, for being there and pointing him in the right direction. (He 
    notified Jeremy of the noodle situation and told him about the nifty 
    lighting)</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down to a very nice attempt 
    at dinner while listening to our favorite songs on a CD.&nbsp; It was odd 
    that he wasn't eating as fast as I was, and the one liners might have given 
    it away as well, but no... I ignored it and wondered why his dad left for 
    the bar.&nbsp; Roger in a bar??&nbsp; Just as a song #6 had ended, the phone 
    rang and he sprinted across the room to answer it.&nbsp; It was his sister 
    Bonnie asking for their dad and I have never heard such short and rude 
    answers in my life.&nbsp; He hung up and pulled the cord out of the wall and 
    came and sat back down.&nbsp; Did I think anything was up?&nbsp; A girl 
    never wants to get her hopes up so I just started reading the wine bottle 
    label. (Three Lakes Winery Cranberry stuff is good)</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok - so Jeremy got back to his seat 
    just as&nbsp; #7 (our number) started playing, KCi and JoJo <i>All My Life
    </i>(our song) and said, &quot;Betsy, I love you and I want to spend the rest of 
    my life with you.&quot;&nbsp; At this point he stood up and kind of pulled me 
    toward him in such a fashion that made me think he wanted to dance.&nbsp; 
    But before I could lead, he dropped to one knee and asked me to marry him.&nbsp; 
    And there it is... how Jeremy proposed to me.&nbsp; It seems as if the 
    things Jeremy did to propose were almost ordinary, but the quirks and messes 
    along the way made it a story that I can tell anyone and everyone for the 
    rest of our lives.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and I said yes.</td>
