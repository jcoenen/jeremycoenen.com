<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently working full-time at Add 
Inc in Waupaca, WI as an Application Developer.&nbsp; I am also taking graduate 
classes in the evenings at UW-Oshkosh for my MBA.&nbsp; I received my 
undergraduate degree from <a href="http://www.snc.edu">St. Norbert College</a> 
in Computer Information Systems.&nbsp; I am the son of Roger and Gloria 
Coenen and the youngest of their four children.&nbsp; </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my free time outside of work, graduate 
school, and spending time with with my lovely fiancée, I enjoy playing sports and spending 
time on the computer.&nbsp; I am usually in 2 or 3 
basketball/volleyball/football leagues during the week and was a member of the 
2002 Spectators football team that finished the season undefeated and claimed 
the HAFFL (Hortonville Area Flag Football League) championship for the first 
time in franchise history. </p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- While dating Betsy, I 
spent a considerable amount of time over at the Fannin residence.&nbsp; Being 
the young love birds that Betsy and I&nbsp; were, we would occasionally try to 
snuggle up to each other late at night on the pea green couch that Robin and 
Kate have in their basement and maybe try to sneak in a kiss or two while 
watching or not watching a movie.&nbsp; Well this type of conduct is strictly 
prohibited in the Fannin household and her parents had instilled the fear of God 
into Betsy.&nbsp; Every time that Betsy or I would be brave enough to try to 
cuddle, no matter how late at night or even if she had made me go up 
and lock the basement door, Betsy within the matter of seconds would always here 
a noise of some sort that she was certain was her mother coming down the stairs 
to check on her.&nbsp; Almost instantly Betsy would push me across to the other 
side of the couch (or completely off) and say, &quot;Shhhh........did you hear that?&nbsp; 
Someone is coming downstairs&quot;&nbsp; I would always reply a disgruntle &quot;NO&quot;, but 
we would have to stop and listen for couple minutes to make sure no one was 
coming.&nbsp; Needless to say this fear has never worn off and I am almost 
willing to bet money that at some point during our wedding night that Betsy will 
wake up and toss me out of bed because she heard her mom coming down those 
stairs.</p>
